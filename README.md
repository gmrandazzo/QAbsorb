# QAbsorb: in silico software to predict passive permeability of natural products

![Screenshot](QAbsorb.png)

QAbsorb is a software designed to help scientist in the prediction of natural product passive permeability.
The software is writen in python language and the graphic interface is developed in PyQt5.
Starting from the RDKit molecular descriptors, scikit-learn statistical engine and natural producs databases,
QAbsorb actually is able to predict:

- Gastrointestinal passive permeability (PAMPA-HMD model) [1]
